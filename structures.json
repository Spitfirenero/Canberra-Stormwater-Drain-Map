      "description": "This is a great begginer drain to start draining in. It has two dry entrances which is rare for storm water drains. It has two main features; being a multi-height vent room and a large chamber known as \"The TEMPLE of DOOM!\". \n The upstream entrance looks like it is inacessable, however, on either side someone has cut a small section of the bars which you can squeeze through. Be careful with this entrance as you do have to climb up/down a ladder about 1-1.5m tall to use it, additionaly you come out above Sulwood drive on a hill which can be hard to cimb up/down. There is an access road which leads up to this entrance near the Mt. Taylor carpark.",
